			<h4 id="h4"> Education </h4>
			<p> Children in domestic violence need to be educated on how to overcome their situation as well as measures to take to avert the domestic violence. The children need to be empowered to report any incidences of the abuse to the local administrators without fear of the victimization. In areas where they are prone to domestic violence there are child protection centres to offer shelter as they investigate the situation.</p>
